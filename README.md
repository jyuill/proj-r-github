# proj-r-github
Testing RStudio + Github integration features

## Scenarios Covered include:

### Roll-backs

#### How do I roll back to a previous version of a file?

1. RStudio > Git window > History
2. Find file version you want to roll back to
3. View File @ <commit id> to open
4. Save As...different file name or overwrite existing
5. Commit (and Push)

#### Can I recover a deleted file?

Yes: just use same process as above to find the file version you want in a commit before it was deleted and Save As.

### Conflict resolution

#### Local file is ahead of remote

### General

#### If I delete a file in the remote repository and have a newer version in the local repository, will it get deleted when I pull from the remote repository?
